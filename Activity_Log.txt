Alex: Well, I made some progress on the Unity tutorial, and then got set back. Again. This time it was not only a reset 
of the files, it was some sort of mistake in the code! So now I have to rebuild the file and follow exactly what happened in the video
and hope it works. At least assistance was offered, and I hope I won't have to make use of it, but at least I have a fallback if need
be. I'm not sure learning 3rd dimensional right off the bat was a good call, but I've made my choice, and I'll stick with it. I 
actually wonder if Xander and Evan can see this.

Alright, after due consideration, I've decided to work with 2D Unity for a few reasons. 1) Coding a 2D game sounds like less of a pain and probably is.
2) Going 3D without using a microgame template is jarring and a rather painful experience, and I'd prefer to get something working ASAP. And 3) I made a joke about a game idea
that I'm now legitimately considering. At any rate, I gotta tell the group before anything even begins, and something tells me that I won't be able to reach them Wednesdays.
So unfortunately, nothing will get done today. There are installs I need to work and they aren't here. Gotta remember to bring this in.
