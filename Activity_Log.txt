Alex: Well, I made some progress on the Unity tutorial, and then got set back. Again. This time it was not only a reset 
of the files, it was some sort of mistake in the code! So now I have to rebuild the file and follow exactly what happened in the video
and hope it works. At least assistance was offered, and I hope I won't have to make use of it, but at least I have a fallback if need
be. I'm not sure learning 3rd dimensional right off the bat was a good call, but I've made my choice, and I'll stick with it. I 
actually wonder if Xander and Evan can see this.

Alright, after due consideration, I've decided to work with 2D Unity for a few reasons. 1) Coding a 2D game sounds like less of a pain and probably is.
2) Going 3D without using a microgame template is jarring and a rather painful experience, and I'd prefer to get something working ASAP. And 3) I made a joke about a game idea
that I'm now legitimately considering. At any rate, I gotta tell the group before anything even begins, and something tells me that I won't be able to reach them Wednesdays.
So unfortunately, nothing will get done today. There are installs I need to work and they aren't here. Gotta remember to bring this in.

Well, today is the day. We start a new game. Only because Unity 3D hates my guts and I hate it with every digit of my body. Evan
wants to recreate a game called "Shrek-Kart". I'm a little hesitant, but a project is a project and at this rate the less we have
to think about the better. Even though we'll continue into next year, at least we'll have something to improve on. Honestly, I
think I was in over my head starting the first one. Perhaps instead of watching and following tutorials, I just wing it and see
what happens. Like a calculator, but with C# and a bunch of projectiles.

I found scripting tutorials for C#. Future me will be grateful for this while past me looks up from the mess and muck in anger
and disgust, cursing present me's name. So I'll be working on these tutorials for quite some time. Not entirely sure how long,
but it'll be long enough to figure out how to actually make something move and make that movement controllable. I'm not sure what
Evan and Xander have been up to, but I can always ask them. I hope they have some form of an activity log they keep somewhere, or use
this one. Y'know, looking at past entries, I can see why past me hates present me right now...

Today I continue watching the C# tutorials, I'm grateful for recent past me for discovering these sacred files, dawning the Era of Corn. Soon all the code shall be blessed in
cob. Jokes aside, I shall continue my crusade and hopefully learn enough C# to start on some project. I'm gonna let the group know my plan with the Godhunters project.

So I have no idea what I am doing. The C# stuff is a bit too confusing for me, but im trying my best to manage these issues. 
I don't know if I've chosen the right class or not but I don't want to fail the team. 
I hope Alex makes me do more research than coding, because this crap sharpy suuucks
